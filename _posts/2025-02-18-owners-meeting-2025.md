We have a number of rule change suggestions to discuss and vote on prior to the league year beginning. Owners, please look over the following suggestions and prepare to vote beginning this Thursday 20th February until Thursday 27th February, at which point we'll and open up the new league year.

_Note: I personally think suggestion 1 and 2 are contingent and would have a double effect if both were brought in. Change 1 would make points much more important, and Change 2 would then do that even moreso. So we may need to mitigate against the combination of these suggestions by, if they're both voted through, voting again on whether to bring in Change 1, Change 2, or both._

### 1. Add a "Vs average" game each week - Andover Sandslashers

Each week, the top six point scorers would receive a bonus point, and the bottom six would receive 0.

e.g. you lose your matchup but you're in the top 6 scorers for the week, you're 1-1 that week. Win your matchup and top six, you're 2-0.

### 2. Playoff qualification shakeup - Andover Sandslashers

To make playoffs, the 3 teams that finished top of division, then the next 3 highest scoring. (Instead of 2 best record + 1 highest scoring)

### 3. Taxi squad claim change - Andover Sandslashers

Claiming 2nd year taxi squad players at a 1 round reduced price (so the round they were drafted in). Currently this is the round above where they were drafted for both first and second year taxi players.

### 4. Teams able to request opponents for specific weeks - Andover Sandslashers

This could be because of in-person meetups or for more interesting final weeks.

- Must be declared before bye weeks are announced
- Must still follow the 3 Div - 6 Other - 3 Div rule
- Both teams must be in favour

Commish adds: I'd recommend these must be declared before the NFL schedule is released in May, so perhaps by end of April. Then any that have been requested will be actioned when I randomise the schedule, by moving weeks around.

### 5. In-Season Waiver Pickups keeper rules - Oxford Seahawks

Proposal:

Only 2 free agents picked up via waivers can be kept per season, with the rest being returned to the free agency auction on July 1st. Each team would declare their "keeper" waiver pickup in February and the rest would be released. Only waiver pickups from the start of Week 1 onwards would be subject to this rule.

Rationale:

I believe this rule would increase the FA pool and enhance the dynasty experience. Keeps it rewarding to have found a waiver gem in-season, but as we have a VERY limited number of worthwhile free agents in the auction, forces more players back into the FA pool each July.

Waiver pickups during the season are often less "dynasty-skill" and are usually just bye-week fill-ins or $0 pickups as a flyer. Beyond 1 lucky pickup, they shouldn't have such a long-term effect on a roster.
