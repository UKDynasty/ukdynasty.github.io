### 1.01 - Coventry Eagles - RB Ashton Jeanty, Las Vegas Raiders

![image](/images/rookie-draft-2025/jeanty.webp)

Ashton Jeanty will be swapping the liminal blue turf of Boise State for the liminal streets of Coventry, as the Eagles have selected the former Bronco with the first overall pick in the 2025 Rookie Draft. Jeanty was a standout at Boise State, where he rushed for 2,601 yards and 	29 touchdowns in his final season, leading the FBS with a ridiculous 7.0 yards per carry on 374 attempts.

The Eagles obtained the first overall pick for good reason - a 4-10 finish is a far cry from their Championship-winning history - and with only four running backs on the roster, Ashton Jeanty is the obvious pick to reinvigorate their future. "After a humbling fall from grace, I knew I needed a game-changer," said Coventry GM Phil Aston. "I took \[him\] first overall because his production and draft stock don't lie."

Jeanty was widely expected to earn elite-level draft capital in the NFL Draft last month, and his selection at sixth overall by the Las Vegas Raiders puts him in lofty company as the highest pick used on a running back since Saquon Barkley went second overall in 2018.

"This isn‚Äôt just a pick; it‚Äôs a declaration." Aston added sternly. "This isn't a rebuild, it's a resupply and Jeanty is driving the bus."

### 1.02 - Chippenham Beavers - RB Omarion Hampton, Los Angeles Chargers

The first of four (!) first-round picks for the Beavers. With multiple 1500-yard rushing seasons at North Carolina, Omarion Hampton walks into a decent situation in Los Angeles in tandem with Najee Harris, and a wide-open running back room at the Beavers, where only Travis Etienne and Javonte Williams really stand as any competition to being the Chippenham RB1.

"An easy pick, and in another Jeanty-less draft he‚Äôs probably the 1.01," said Beavers GM Tom Butler via live video link from a packed and busy war-room. "A welcome addition to a Beavers team crying out for RB stability."

If the Chargers let Hampton use his receiving chops - he caught 38 passes for 373 yards and 2 touchdowns in his final season at North Carolina - he could be a real asset for Chippenham early and often.

### 1.03 - Flitwick Fireflies - RB Treveyon Henderson, New England Patriots

A second-round NFL Draft pick by the New England Patriots, Henderson brings a modern running back skillset to the NFL and now to the Flitwick Fireflies. He is a versatile back with the ability to catch passes out of the backfield, and he has the speed and agility to make defenders miss in the open field, running a 4.43 40-yard dash as part of an impressive overall combine performance.

If Henderson can secure a role alongside, or even usurp, incumbent back and fellow Firefly Rhamondre Stevenson, and carve out a three-down role, Henderson has the talent to be an elite-level fantasy producer.

"I love Henderson for his running; I love Henderson for his catching," said GM Mike Ki-Fun. "I love Henderson for his blocking but most of all I love Henderson because he means I don‚Äôt have to put my Grandma in at running back".

You could say this is the first ADP-based surprise of the draft, with Henderson's consensus mock draft rank taking a small post-draft dip to around the 1.07 mark on average, but the Fireflies may have taken their ownership of Stevenson into account here in securing Henderson's services.

### 1.04 - Chippenham Beavers - WR (Hopefully) Travis Hunter, Jacksonville Jaguars

The Jaguars traded their 2026 1st rounder, amongst other things, to move up three spots and take Travis Hunter with the second overall pick in the NFL Draft.

The former two-way star at Colorado has the potential to be a game-changer at wide receiver, and obvious WR1 upside, but comes with inherent risk. The Jaguars have proclaimed that Hunter will be a wide receiver, but should he struggle early, or more likely, show more on defense in rookie minicamps or training camp, there is always a chance he is moved to the other side of the ball.

However, with a total of four first round picks in hand, the Beavers have the luxury of taking a swing on a player with elite upside, and Hunter is that player. 

On the pick, GM Butler said: "A polarising pick it would seem‚Ä¶ but a Heismann trophy winner and 5th overall pick speaks volumes about what Travis Hunter is as a player." 

"If he were only considered a WR, he‚Äôd probably be the 1.01 over Jeanty, and anyone that doubts that needs to check out Matt Harmon's analysis of him (and he has a terrific record of being right about these guys‚Ä¶). No gamble for me, I expect Hunter to be a full-time WR that might get some snaps on defence, and at 1.04 I think he‚Äôs an absolute steal."

### 1.05 - Cymru Cobras - WR Tetairoa McMillan, Carolina Panthers

The Cobras seemed to have finally taken a step in 2024, finishing in second place in the Midlands with a 7-7 record and the first non-losing season for the franchise since records began.

They will look to continue that trend with the help of Tet McMillan, whose draft stock puts him in heady company after being taken eighth overall by the Carolina Panthers. Busts with that kind of draft capital are few and far between, and McMillan is a player who has the potential to be a true WR1 in the NFL, with a Mike Evans-like/lite 6'4" frame and multiple 1300+ receiving yard seasons at the University of Arizona.

"The Cobras are looking to surprise this year." said Cobras GM Jason Reese. Awkwardly pausing for a moment to side-ete Treylon Burks, he added: "With this guy, we feel we are filling a hole that has been missing for a long time. This year is our Tet year."

### 1.06 - Nottingham Bandits - WR Matthew Golden, Green Bay Packers

The Bandits add some much-needed depth to their WR room. I joke, as Golden becomes the seventeenth man in said room, with perhaps more due later (spoiler alert).

The Packers aren't known for taking wide receivers early in the NFL draft, far from it - he was their first WR taken in the first since 2002. But the holder of the fastest 40-yard dash time of the combine, Golden is a speedy receiver who can stretch the field for Jordan Love.

"Not super enthusiastic about picking at this spot, but no-one sent me any trade offers so had to get things moving." said Bandits GM Josh Ridge. "Not who I wanted to pick most but I think he (or she!) might be there for my next pick, so gambled on what looks to me like the best value in the meantime."

### 1.07 - Chippenham Beavers - RB Quinshon Judkins, Cleveland Browns

The Beavers double up on the running back position, with a powerful downfield runner in Quinshon Judkins, who was taken in the second round of the NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns.

"Another likely workhorse RB makes it‚Äôs way to the Beavers," grinned Chippenham boss Tom Butler. "And no other players were really in consideration once he was available. Hopefully he and Hampton can be the backs that propel the Beavers to contention oncemore."

### 1.08 - Oxford Seahawks - TE Tyler Warren, Indianapolis Colts

![image](/images/rookie-draft-2025/warren.jpg)

The second tight end taken in the NFL draft is the first taken in the UKD rookie draft, as the Seahawks select Tyler Warren with the eighth overall pick.

Warren was a second-round pick by the Indianapolis Colts, and is a versatile, athletic tight end who can block and catch passes in equal measure. He has the potential to be a key part of the Colts' offense, but who is throwing him the ball this season?

"The Seahawks are looking to build a dynasty, and Tyler Warren is a key part of that plan." said GM Dan Abrey. "He has the potential to be a top-3 or top-5 tight end in dynasty and he's relatively young as a rookie; we're happy to wait a year or two if necessary while the Colts sort out their quarterback situation moving forwards."

### 1.09 - Chippenham Beavers - WR Emeka Egbuka, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

![image](/images/rookie-draft-2025/egbuka.webp)

There were whispers of the first trade of draft day here, but in the end the Beavers stood pat and made their fourth pick of the first round, which must surely be a UKD record.

"We tried to move out of this pick, but struggled to get a deal done." confirmed boss Tom Butler. "In the end, Egbuka got the call as a WR I won‚Äôt need to produce this year, but offers great long term prospects once Mike Evans and Chris Godwin inevitably move on."

In Egbuka they get a wide receiver who just loves to have the ball in his hands, and while the initial depth chart looks somewhat problematic at the Bucs, his first round draft capital and talent should see him produce fantasy relevance from year one.

### 1.10 - Lurgan Leopards - WR Jayden Higgins, Houston Texans

![image](/images/rookie-draft-2025/higgins.webp)

The Leopards take Jayden Higgins, a wide receiver who was selected in the second round of the NFL Draft by the Houston Texans. Higgins is a big-bodied receiver oddly enough in a similar mould to new teammate Nico Collins.

"To be truthful, we wanted Golden." said Leopards boss Dermy McAlinden. "He could be the best WR in the class, but so could Higgins so I‚Äôm glad we have him. We scouted him extensively and he has all the qualities to be a leopard. üêÜ"

### 1.11 - Nottingham Bandits - WR Luther Burden, Chicago Bears

![image](/images/rookie-draft-2025/burden.webp)

Was this she? With the Bandits seemingly taking Matthew Golden 'just because' earlier in the day, this may well have been who they wanted all along.

Burden was selected in the second round of the NFL Draft, and has been a bit of an enigma when it comes to post-NFL draft rankings for analysts. His talent is unquestionable, but a quiet final season at Missouri and a very crowded depth chart at Chicago - an offense where production is highly predicted but not guaranteed - has left many not quite sure where he sits in the pecking order.

Said Bandits boss Josh Ridge:

"To the tune of beasts of burden by the rolling stones:

The Bandits got their man in Luther Burden,  
Being there at eleven wasn't certain,  
I was tempted, to take him early  

Would he fall enough?  
Is it late enough?  
This is really tough  
I got him I'm happy!"

Burden's aforementioned unquestionable talent and potential for game-breaking YAC plays will see him make waves whenever he does get the ball, and he joins the even more crowded WR room at the Bandits, where he will be competing with the likes of CeeDee Lamb, Ladd McConkey and Chris Godwin.

### 1.12 - Coventry Eagles - TE Colston Loveland, Chicago Bears

![image](/images/rookie-draft-2025/loveland.jpg)

It's a story of the End of the First Round and the Two Bears, with Coventry selecting Michigan tight end Colston Loveland. It was somewhat of a shock when the Bears selected Loveland in the first round of the NFL Draft with Tyler Warren still sat in the green room, but his receiving profile and athleticism make him a great fit for a modern NFL offense.

If Ben Johnson can get the best out of all of his new weapons, which does at this point seem nigh-on impossible, or if Loveland can carve out one of the top two or three spots in target share, he could be a real asset for the Eagles.

"It is long overdue for the Midlands Division to return to what it does best," said Eagles boss Phil Aston. "Stockpile TEs."

"I've taken the most complete rookie TE in this year's draft. Thank god for flex positions."
