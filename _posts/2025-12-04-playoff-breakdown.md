## UK Dynasty Playoff Outlook

It all comes down to this, the final week, this is the time where hearts start to be broken, and
dreams turn into reality. To follow will be a view of Each Teams playoff needs and a view at
the Johnny Race. For the Purposes of this article, anything more than a 50-point swing is
being considered impossible as otherwise, anyone can make playoffs.

### We start in the North

| Team     | Record | PF      | PB     |
|----------|:------:|--------:|-------:|
| Leopards | 6-7    | 1232.60 | 0.00   |
| Bandits  | 6-7    | 1155.76 | 76.84  |
| Wombats  | 6-7    | 1147.28 | 85.32  |
| Spartans | 3-10   | 1252.56 | -19.96 |

In a large turn of events, the North Division is the new “Someone has to win it” division in the
UK Dynasty League. 3 teams sit at 6-7 and somehow, the highest scoring team in the
division is not one of them. Let’s take a look at how things could play out.

The Lurgan Leopards currently sit top of the division. This is a “win, and you’re in” situation
for the Leopards and they are facing a Bandits team who they beat by a 29-point margin
back in week 3.

The Nottingham Bandits also need a win this week to try and secure the divisional win, but
they must also make sure that they do so while not being outscored by the Wombats by 8.5
points.

The Wigan Wombats must beat the Gateshead Spartans this week, something they were
able to do in week 3 by 3 points, but also need the Bandits to win, and to outscore the
Bandits by 8.5 points, in order to claim back-to-back North Division Titles.
The Gateshead Spartans cannot qualify for playoffs. Johnny is watching

### Onto the Midlands

| Team     | Record | PF      | PB     |
|----------|:------:|--------:|-------:|
| Eagles   | 10-3   | 1450.44 | 0.00   |
| Otters   | 7-6    | 1359.86 | 90.58  |
| Cobras   | 7-6    | 1324.70 | 125.74 |
| Fireflies| 4-9    | 1128.30 | 322.14 |

The Coventry Eagles have completed a remarkable turnaround this season to go from
Johnny to Midlands Division champions in 1 season, however, they can still become the #1 if
they win this week against the Cymru Cobras, and the Sandslashers fail to beat the Pythons.

The Derby Otters need to simply match the result of the Cymru Cobras and not fall foul of a
35-point swing.

The Cymru Cobras need to either beat the result of the Otters or match it and overcome a 35
points swing in order to make it into playoffs as the #5.

The Flitwick Fireflies can ignore playoffs. Johnny is looming close.

### And the South

| Team         | Record | PF       | PB      |
|--------------|:------:|---------:|--------:|
| Sandslashers | 10-3   | 1589.78  | 0.00    |
| Seahawks     | 9-4    | 1548.54  | 41.24   |
| Pythons      | 6-7    | 1175.94  | 413.84  |
| Beavers      | 4-9    | 1395.10  | 194.68  |

The new powerhouse in the league, 3 of the top 4 scoring teams live in the south and all 3
are destined for playoffs. What a terrible time to be the defending Champion Oxford Pythons
to be the only team in your division to not make playoffs. Ouch.

The Andover Sandslashers have the #1 as long as they beat the Oxford Pythons.

The Oxford Seahawks are guaranteed Playoffs and have secure the #4 at a minimum. A win
against the Chippenham Beavers, a Sandslashers loss and a 41.3-point swing would see
the Seahawks secure at least the #2, add an Eagles loss and the Seahawks can secure the
#1. No matter how unlikely it may seem, this is the week for drama. This is the week for the
unexpected.

The Oxford Pythons are eliminated from playoff contention and have nothing to worry about.
Get started on your draft prep Olly.

The Chippenham Beavers are currently occupying the #6 as highest points scorer. Despite a
record which should have the Beavers in the Johnny conversation, it looks highly unlikely
anything other than a playoff berth will happen for the 4-9 Beavers.

### Johnny

| Team      | Record | PF      | PB     |
|-----------|:------:|--------:|-------:|
| Spartans  | 3-10   | 1252.56 | 0.00  |
| Fireflies | 4-9    | 1128.30 | 124.26|

And then, there were 2. A big points advantage for the Spartans, but the record advantage
lies with the Fireflies. For the Fireflies, a win against the Otters makes you safe, nice and
simple. But a Spartans win against the Wombats would pile on the pressure as there would
be zero room for error left in Flitwick. The one sweetener in becoming the latest in a long line
of used Johnnys, is the 1 st overall pick in the first ever Live UK Dynasty Rookie Draft, so who
knows, maybe it could be worth the title of Johnny on this occasion.
### Final Thoughts

| Team       | Record | PF      | PB      |
|------------|:------:|--------:|--------:|
| Sandslashers| 10-3  | 1589.78 | 0.00   |
| Eagles     | 10-3   | 1450.44 | 139.34 |
| Seahawks   | 9-4    | 1548.54 | 41.24  |
| Otters     | 7-6    | 1359.86 | 229.92 |
| Cobras     | 7-6    | 1324.70 | 265.08 |
| Leopards   | 6-7    | 1232.60 | 357.18 |
| Pythons    | 6-7    | 1175.94 | 413.84 |
| Bandits    | 6-7    | 1155.76 | 434.02 |
| Wombats    | 6-7    | 1147.28 | 442.50 |
| Beavers    | 4-9    | 1395.10 | 194.68 |
| Fireflies  | 4-9    | 1128.30 | 461.48 |
| Spartans   | 3-10   | 1252.56 | 337.22 |

The story this season is all about the odd seedings in the playoffs, Who will secure the #1
seed between the Sandslashers, Eagles and Seahawks? Who will be dragged kicking and
screaming into the #3 seed by winning the North? Who will make it in as the #5 as runner up
of the Midlands? It’s going to be a lot more drama than I think some of us expected this
season. Would it be embarrassing for Jason to miss out on playoffs to a bot team? Would it
be shameful for 4-10 to be the finishing Johnny record, but also the record of the #6 seed?
Would we fold the league if that same 4-10 team won it all? Who knows, but it’s all great fun
for a free Dynasty League in its 10 th Season isn’t it?
